    <h1>Sahithi Kasarapu</h1>
    <h6>BasketBall</h6>
    <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
         opposing one another on a rectangular court, <b>compete with the primary objective of 
         shooting a basketball</b> (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the 
         defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) 
         high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team 
         from <b>shooting</b> through their own hoop</p>
