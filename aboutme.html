    <h4>A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN</h4>
    <p>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the first novel
        of Irish writer James Joyce. A KÃ¼nstlerroman written in a modernist style,
        it traces the religious and intellectual awakening of young Stephen Dedalus,
        Joyce's fictional alter ego, whose surname alludes to Daedalus, Greek mythology's
        consummate craftsman</p>
